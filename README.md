# Learning to Program With Ruby

This content is designed with the intention of teaching introductory programming concepts to a group of 40 girls in grade 6. 
It's meant to be used along with the assignments, worksheets, and puzzles provided.

Feedback is more than welcome, and in fact very much appreciated!

# Thanks

A big thank you to Ladies Learning Code, for giving me a great reason to compile beginner Ruby content in the first place.
This content is based heavily on the material I originally produced for the Ladies Learning Code {Intro to Ruby}[https://github.com/dessy/ladieslearningcode-ruby] workshop.
