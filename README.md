# Thanks

A big thank you to [Ladies Learning Code](http://ladieslearningcode.com/), for giving me a great reason to 
compile beginner Ruby content in the first place. This content is based heavily on the material I originally produced for the 
Ladies Learning Code [Intro to Ruby](https://github.com/dessy/ladieslearningcode-ruby) workshop.
